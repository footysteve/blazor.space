I've been thinking about how SEO would work with Blazor/WebAssembly so did a little investigation.

First I tried some seo analysis tools which gave scores ranging from 0 to 73 / 100 depending. This confirmed what I'd been thinking - namely that there might be some issues indexing wasm apps.
Then I indexed balzor.space with the "Fetch as Google" tool in the google search concole which gives a good idea of what a search engine sees.

This is the result of the indexing:

You can see google isn't able to glean much about content.
